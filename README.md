This marketing website serves as the primary conversion tool, turning visitors into qualified leads through compelling content, intuitive design, and interactive elements.

**Core Technologies:**
- **Next.js**: React framework for server-rendered applications

## Design Choices

### Color Palette
The teal/cyan color scheme was deliberately chosen to evoke:
- **Trust**: Blues convey reliability and security, essential for a financial platform
- **Technology**: Cyan tones suggest innovation and digital advancement
- **Clarity**: The clean palette creates visual hierarchy and readability

The gradients transition subtly to create depth without distracting from content, while the dark mode implementation maintains the brand identity with adjusted contrast ratios.

### Animations and Interactions
Framer Motion is used strategically to enhance user engagement:
- Staggered reveal animations trigger as users scroll into each section
- Subtle hover effects indicate interactive elements
- Page transitions maintain context between navigation changes
- Micro-animations provide feedback for user actions (button clicks, form submissions)

Animations are implemented with reduced motion preferences in mind, respecting user accessibility settings.

### Responsive Design Strategy
- Component-based breakpoint system using Tailwind's responsive modifiers
- Strategic content prioritization on mobile (hiding secondary images, condensing text)
- Touch-optimized interactions for mobile users (larger touch targets, swipe gestures)
- Custom navigation pattern that transforms from horizontal to hamburger menu

### UI/UX Decisions
- Progressive disclosure in the FAQ section reduces cognitive load
- Form feedback is immediate and contextual, highlighting errors inline
- Chat widget remains unobtrusive until needed, with clear visual cues
- Above-the-fold content focuses exclusively on the core value proposition

### Accessibility Considerations
- WCAG AA compliance throughout the site
- Semantic HTML structure with appropriate ARIA attributes
- Keyboard navigation support with visible focus states
- Color contrast ratios exceeding minimum requirements
- Screen reader optimized content with descriptive alt text
